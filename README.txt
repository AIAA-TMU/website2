AIAA TMU Website
==================

This simple site is made of two files:

- index.html  → the homepage with the hero section and Join Us button.
- style.css   → the styling.

Editing content
---------------
Open **index.html** in any code editor.
Replace the `<h1>` text to change the headline.
Change the link in the `<a>` tag if your Discord invitation ever changes.

Adding pages
------------
Duplicate *index.html* and rename it (e.g., `about.html`).
Adjust the content inside and add navigation links if needed.

Deploying
---------
Drop the two files onto your TMU server, or enable GitHub Pages
by committing them to any repository and enabling Pages in its settings.
